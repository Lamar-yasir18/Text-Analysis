## Usage
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Lamar-yasir18/text-analysis.git
cd text-analysis

Run the script: Execute your Jupyter notebook or Python script that contains the analysis code.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is the Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset, which can be found here.

The dataset includes the following columns:
sentiment: The sentiment label (0 for negative, 4 for positive).
text: The tweet text.

## Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps include:

-Dropping unnecessary columns.

-Mapping sentiment labels to positive and negative.

-Removing duplicates.

-Shuffling and sampling the dataset for balanced classes.

-Lowercasing the text.

-Removing stop words, emails, URLs, punctuations, and numbers.

-Tokenization and lemmatization.

-Visualizing sentiment distribution using bar plots.

-Generating word clouds for positive and negative sentiments.

-Modeling

The project uses the following models:

Bag of Words (BOW):
-Initialized a CountVectorizer to convert text data into a matrix of token counts.
-Fit a Logistic Regression model and evaluated its accuracy.
TF-IDF:
-Used TfidfVectorizer for feature extraction.
-Fit another Logistic Regression model and evaluated its accuracy.

## Results
Accuracy using Bag of Words: 75.63%

Accuracy using TF-IDF: 76.04%
